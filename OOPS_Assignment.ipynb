        "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Assignment in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "#### A way of structuring code using objects and classes. It makes complex programs easier to manage by grouping related data and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "#### A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "#### An object is an instance of a class. It contains real values instead of just the design.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "#### Abstraction hides complexity and shows only the essentials. Encapsulation hides the internal state and allows access only through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "#### “Dunder” means double underscore, like `__init__`, `__str__`. These are special methods that customize class behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "#### Inheritance lets one class (child) use the properties and methods of another class (parent), avoiding code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "#### Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It allows different classes to be treated as the same interface. Example: `+` works with both numbers and strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "#### Using private variables (by convention: `_var` or `__var`) and getters/setters methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "#### A constructor is the `__init__` method that runs automatically when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "#### Class method (`@classmethod`) uses `cls` and affects the whole class. Static method (`@staticmethod`) doesn’t need `self` or `cls`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "#### Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (not fully supported in Python like other languages).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "#### When a child class redefines a method from the parent class to change its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "#### `@property` allows you to define methods that behave like attributes for cleaner access to private data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "#### It allows flexibility — the same function can work with different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "#### A class that can’t be instantiated directly and is meant to be inherited. It contains abstract methods that must be defined by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "#### Reusability, modularity, easier maintenance, and better organization of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "#### Class variable is shared across all instances. Instance variable is unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "#### A class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. Explain the purpose of ‘__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ methods in Python\n",
        "#### `__str__` returns a user-friendly string. `__repr__` returns a developer-friendly string for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "#### `super()` lets you call methods from a parent class in a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "#### It’s called when an object is deleted. It can be used to clean up resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "#### Static doesn’t use class or instance data. Class method works on the class itself using `cls`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "#### A parent class reference can point to a child class object and call its method, enabling dynamic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "#### Calling multiple methods in a single line like: `obj.method1().method2()` by returning `self` from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "#### It allows an object to be called like a function.\n"
